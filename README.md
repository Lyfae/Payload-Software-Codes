Hi Guys! 
So, many of you guys are wondering how to use Github so I will be giving you guys are really quick rundown on how to create and upload files. 

*Creating files and folders*

-In order to create a new file click on the "Create new file" box next to the "Upload Files" and "Find Files" boxes. 
-After you have successfully done that, you will then type in the name of your file and then go down to the bottom and commit the changes. 
-If you want to create a folder and simply use the "/" after you have written the name of your folder and it should create a new box in which you can add more folders
or just input the files that you want to upload. 

*Uploading*

-First you would want to click on the file you would like to upload it to.
-From there, you would click onto the "Upload files" box and it should send you to a new page where it would prompt you to add files. 
-You can either drag the documents or anything from your folder to the box and it would upload it for you. Just be patient with big ones for they can take a while. 
-From there, you can edit your files and take out any that you don't want to upload. 
-After that, just click on the commit button and you are done!

*If you have any questions, let me know in discord or if you are absolutely lost, just send them my way and I can upload them for you guys!*
